# YearWork-DMC

This is an individual course project of 'Dynamics of Mechanical Systems' done in 2018.1 in Politecnico di Milano, Italy. (Professor: Stefano Bruni)

THe project is about to analysis the dynamic properties of a given complex beam-model by finite element approach, and then improve the model to achieve a required performance under particular limitations, whether by change the design (shape) or change the beam section type or any other approach.

Language: English

Instruction of the project is given in 'Yearwork+2017-2018.pdf'. 

The folder 'FEM+software' contains the Matlab program given by the professors, and more details can be found in the file ABOUT.TXT in the folder.

The folder 'CAI_898708' contains the done work, where the 'Report.docx' sums up the whole project.
